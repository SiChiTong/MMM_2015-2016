(x,y,z axes based on frontal view)

upper fingers 1.00 cm above lower
fingers 1,3,5 extension 1.00 cm
fingers 2,4 extension 3.50 cm

upper servo 25mm above lower, 23.37mm horizontal offset from lower
servos on same vertical level 46.666mm offset

there is a small gap between servos and bottom of servo casings to allow for error

edges of fingers around hand may need to be rounded to allow enough rotation to press keys
