Over the course the the 2015-2016 school year, the Multipurpose Mobile Manipulator Mk 1 was tested with 50 undergraduates
at Carnegie Mellon University as an advanced educational robotics platform. Mostly comprising of first year students with 
little to no prior robotics experience, students from across all disciplines got hands on experience working with a research 
grade robot and got a taste of the entire scope of robotics: perception, cognition, and actuation. After being given tutorials 
on CAD modeling, Arduino programming and Python scripting with provided libraries, students were split into 10 groups of 3-5 
people each with the objective of getting the Multipurpose Mobile Manipulator to perform an interesting task. Working roughly 
2 hours per week for 20 weeks, here is a list of the tasks we successfully got the Multipurpose Mobile Manipulator to do:

Playing Piano
Bagel Delivery
Watering Plants
Picking Up Legos
Drawing Pictures
Toy Dart Combat
Stirring Pots
Hot Dog Assembly
Cereal Feeder
Toy Sword Dueling
